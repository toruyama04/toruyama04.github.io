          Assemble a whole room/class of people. The goal for every individual
          is to accrue some amount of points, lets say ~250. In order to earn
          these points, individuals must complete tasks that award differing
          number of points. The easy tasks will only give a few points as
          opposed to more challenging tasks. The general themes here involved
          communication, teamwork, general skills and can be used to evaluate
          people's natural strengths...

        <h4>Why</h4>
        <p>
          whilst this does't necessarily have to be an icebreaker, I found that
          that during my time tutoring that the usual ice-breakers weren't
          something most kids were that great at (2 truths 1 lie, desert-island
          items). I think getting people to do activities that envoke more
          natural ways of getting to know others makes more sense. In particular
          this activity allows participants to choose how they achieve the
          required threshold. Furthermore, it highlights skills that are
          required by the activity, such as the those which require the whole
          group to participate will have people who act as the leader.
